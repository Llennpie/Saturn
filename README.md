# LMG64 Saturn

- **Saturn** is an all-in-one machinima studio for *Super Mario 64*, based on [the PC port](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex).
- *In order to download or compile the editor, a prior copy of the game is required. This is to avoid including any copyrighted material.*
This version of Saturn is trying to be an improved experience. I hightly recommend downloading the [original.](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn/releases/latest)
