# Saturn: Moon Edition

- *Saturn: Moon Edition* is a cross-platform all-in-one machinima studio for *Super Mario 64*, based on [Undervolt/Moon64](https://github.com/Undervolt/Moon64).
- In order to download, use or compile the editor, a prior copy of the game is required. This is to avoid including any copyrighted assets or material.
- *Detailed, extensive guides can be found on our [wiki](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn/wiki).*

#### Features

```

  - A "free camera", can be frozen in place or moved with the joystick.
- Custom eye textures
  - Loaded externally as PNG files
  - Can be selected through a dropdown
- Color code editor
  - Uses the common *GameShark* format
  - Complete visual CC editor
  - Color presets save as a .gs file for later use
- Chroma Key Stage
  - Background is color-changeable to any RGB/Hex code
- Animation Player
  - Can play all 209 of Mario's in-game animations
  - Supports looping/first-person to move head
- Toggles for HUD, Mario's cap emblem, overall buttons, voices, head rotations, shadows, dust particles and more
- Switch between cap states (on/off/wing) and hand poses (victory/open/holding hat/etc.)
- Warp to any level from the menu
- Custom textures (& texture packs) support
  - All textures are 100% customizable
- Settings manager
  - All options from sm64ex and Moon64 (minus configuring controls, currently) carry over to the new UI
  - Option to disable music and Mario's voice for machinima purposes
  - Addons Menu, to switch priority/order of texture packs & more
- "Anti-aliasing" (not really, just clever internal resolution scaling, works better with cross-platform)
- "Jabo Mode", a toggle to recreate the infamous weird widescreen stretching, as seen in many Project64 graphics plugins.
- "Wireframe Mode", it just looks really cool...
```

*... And more to come!*

## Installation

### Download (recommended)

To download *Moon Edition*, follow these instructions:
- Install the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn/releases) page.
- Head to the [Moon64 Addons](http://moon64.undervolt.io/addons) website and download the **Moon64 Default Addon**. You will need a vanilla 8 MB ROM to continue *(this is to avoid including any copyrighted assets)*.
- Place the `moon64.bit` file into `addons/`, next to the `saturn/` folder **(but not in)**. Upon launching the game for the first time, it may take a second to extract assets.
- *Optionally, get a [120 star savefile](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/814630624920076298/915021206888001566/Moon64-Save-1.dat) and place in* `%appdata%/SaturnME` *(or* `.local/share/SaturnME` *on Linux).*
