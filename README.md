# LMG64 Saturn

- **Saturn** is an all-in-one machinima studio for *Super Mario 64*, based on [the PC port](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex).
*To download the editor, download the EXE from releases and also download the code by using the code button and hitting "Download ZIP". then place the exe, the discord_game_skl.dll, and a ROM of Super Mario 64 renamed to sm64.z64 (or just sm64 if file extensions are off.) inside of the LMG64-Saturn folder. Right now, this is only for Windows as I do not have a Linux machine.*
This version of Saturn is trying to be an improved experience. I hightly recommend downloading the [original.](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn/releases/latest)
